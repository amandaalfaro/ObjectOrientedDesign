This program reads text from the file named ‘listOfNumbers.txt’ and finds the successor of the array list. 
A problem I ran into was trying to get the conditions of the if statements correct.
This program checks to see if the element at the end of list equals 9, if that it the case then we check if the index equals zero(meaning it must’ve been a list full of 9’s). So if the first element equals zero then we want to add one to the index. 
Next is the else which will just set the last number of the array list to the last element of the array list plus 1.
